# OrgPtcop
Org->PtCop Converter

Developed to provide one-way conversion from Pixel's Organya music format
to his later and more robust PtCop format (used by PxTone).
Due to technical limitations of the organya format, conversion in the opposite direction is not supported.

This application is capable of converting both notes and drum tracks from organya, however due to subtle differences in
the playback engines of each format the resulting sound may not be 100% accurate.

This project also includes a document detailing the binary format of `.ptcop` files as they were understood at the time.
Since this project was originally developed PtCop has been made open source, and more complete information
may be found at http://pxtone.org/developer/ (However, as far as I can tell it's only available in Japanese.)
